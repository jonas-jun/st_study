And another take them? Doubt it They telling me I shouldn't live without it Belief, relief for the doubters, it keeps me clouded Confused while I'm doing the knowledge, but my God said choose I choose you, who do you choose?

Billie Eilish,The Feeling,"[Intro: Jacinto Rhines] The feeling Only the feeling, gives real happiness Only the feeling, nothing less Only the feeling Only the feeling [Verse 1: Blu] The feeling is gone, couldn’t even pen a good song I had to let it go, and ask God to direct my flow My life was blessed, even times when my life was less I kept faith, and God kept me in a good place I faced adversity before, not saying it was worse I’m really saying now it’s even more But I can’t let it put me underground I have a kid to live for, I got to find a way to make him proud Especially when there’s police killing children And you got the nerve to try and ask me how I’m feeling My nigga, I’m a black man, not trying to turn this to a racist thing 'Cause worldwide, we can see that it’s a racist thing I think you’ll understand if I explain it like a man But just being honest yo, I don’t have the plan All I got is two hands, to touch what is real And honestly, I stopped giving a fuck how you feel The feeling [Verse 2: Blu] Aye yo they robbed me for everything I have So all I ever worked for was thrown in the trash They took all my equipment and the masters to my records They took away the biggest part of my child’s investment Questioned, but no I wasn’t given back a dime 'Cause I didn’t have insurance, all they're sure of is the crime And the fact that I’m broke, and my life is on the ropes But I got good health, trying to buy high hopes But you never know Some people lose a lot more, and can’t get it back And that’s why I’m torn I have a huge love for making music to encourage But now I can’t afford to record no more I got warrants for fighting and that made my life a lot harder Not to mention I’m too poor to support my daughter But they’ll never know so I just keep on killin’ it Whether or not I’m even feelin’ it or fulfillin’ The feeling [Verse 3: Blu] Yo, the feeling is true, real, something you can feel The feeling is deeper than any rapper’s record deal The feeling is the healing, not the killing The feeling is one of the reasons I’m still living But I don’t got it brother, all I got now is God And my will that all of me and mines survive I’m trying to let it go, though I never thought I would I kept it so deep inside, I never thought I could Not sure if it returns, or if it just burns But I learned, the feeling is something that’s confirmed Though it’s not eternal, and it’s not deep as love I know back then I felt it like blood I can hug, I can kiss, I can even get dissed But all I know is the feeling will surely be missed I felt you, and yeah it almost felt like I held you The real is the only thing that can replace the feeling The feeling [Refrain: Blu] It’s the feeling It’s the feeling [Outro: Jacinto Rhines] The feeling Only the feeling, gives real happiness Only the feeling, nothing less Only the feeling, makes a friendship true The feeling that I feel for you Only the feeling, makes life feel alright The feeling, every day and night Only the feeling, makes true desire Only the feeling, takes the feeling higher Only the feeling, makes the baby smile Only the feeling, makes a man a child Now only the feeling, makes a house a home Only the feeling, makes a word a poem Joy is the feeling that we feel so strong Only feeling right makes you not feel wrong Lust and greed feeling, others are leaning Without feeling, life has not much meaning Only the feeling, makes true songs to sing Only the feeling, makes God men be king Only choice is right or wrong but never in between Only the feeling, makes a girl a queen Only the feeling, we shouldn’t be dealing No killing, or stealing, when people use feeling Only the feeling, makes your children try Hate for all feeling, makes the heroes die Only the feeling, makes the world at peace Only the feeling, makes love ones release Live life with feeling, drugs don’t have to be Only the feeling, makes your life carefree Only the feeling, makes you feel God’s grace The feeling for the human race Only the feeling, God plants life through seeds inside The feeling of nature, man’s foot is never dry Only the feeling, makes the water flow Only the feeling, makes true birth grow The feeling of self-worth brings joy back to this earth The feeling of self-pride, makes you feel so good inside Self-respect and knock on wood, rejecting lust each man should Only the feeling makes you laugh Feel so good, be thankful and kneeling for the feeling Yes we should be dealing with only the feeling Only the feeling, of great joy from a little girl or boy Oh yes, it’s the feeling, evil can’t destroy Only the feeling, creates harmony The feeling that you feel for me Only the feel of love, makes life feel divine The feeling of friendship, makes you yours, makes you mine Yes, our love is dealing with only the feeling Inspired by Alexis Watson, soulmate, my companion, dedicating the world Epilogue The world is worth healing, because of the feeling Nature’s dealing with

And Malcolm X would wonder ""all y'all are on the same team?"" The way these fiends keep droning on in the mainstream The lame thing about it, it's the same teams that bought it Probably skipping this song, Build the walls around the ignorance Defending what's wrong, instead of fighting for freedom That's why I only write in what I believe in and nothing less [Verse 2] I shoulda listened when my Moms told my ass ""stay in class"" Shoulda listened instead of ditching to get a little ass Or maybe I shoulda listened to my Pops When he told me hip-hop won't do shit, but keep me on the block Or maybe I shoulda listened to my niggas pitching rocks 'Cause they pushing nice whips from cooking white bricks Or maybe I should be like my uncle That nigga pimping white chicks, but none of em lead a life like this It's like the right do righteous to try to stay the fuck out of hell But me, I'm tryna stay the fuck out of jail Cause I can smell trouble coming my way Plus there's so many reasons a nigga wanna keep a gun to his waist It don't take much to make him pull out Cause niggas die for their rides, money and broads or calling the wrong hood out And suckers still tripping on colors like a motherfucking racist My cousin was banging at my Aunt's cookout It's a full-out war and I don't know who to listen to I thought rap was a positive gap I could get in to But nowadays you gotta bust a cap if they dissing you Either that or be labeled a bitch cause you didn't shoot It's hard to pick and choose right from wrong Like if you rap about freedom, nobody likes your song But do a track about cheating, bitches will play it all night long I don't get it why the righteous fall Like my ex used to bump Xzibit and her favorite line was ""I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings"" Yet she don't want me tricking around See, she idolize the lifestyle but don't want none of it going down It's kinda like these phony clowns thinking they hood dwellers Acting Mafioso cause they seen Goodfellas Now they running through the hood yelling Blu is bucking rounds Bet you're giving your attention to me now",2024-05-17,0.6568047337,0.7156613372,35,34,29,17,14,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!",,0.4852071006,0.7943313953,75,61,32,0,34,23,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Under the covers where we used to lay And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe We used each other's air just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We go anywhere, our minds would take us And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that God made us And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again [Chorus] Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now? [Verse 2] And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can’t help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again [Chorus] Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now? [Bridge] Love will come and love will go But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, go Oh won't you leave me now? People grow and fall apart But you can't mend your broken heart Take it back, go Oh won't you leave me now? [Chorus (Extended)] Oh Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and Love will go) Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now? (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been living on the road, Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know, Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that’s you and me both, Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now) Oh, won't you leave me now, now? Oh Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and Love will go) Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now? (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been living on the road, Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know, Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Ed Sheeran,Wake Me Up,"[Verse 1] I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again and just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath, fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable And maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder [Chorus] And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up [Verse 2] And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me? Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR 'Cause I've never owned a blu-ray, true say I know I've always been shit at computer games And your brother always beats me And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you laugh at me, and be asking me If I'm gonna be home next week And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets [Chorus] And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up [Verse 3] And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try and get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I’ll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now [Outro] 'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up",2011-09-09,0.3313609467,0.6655159884,62,21,90,0,14,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ed Sheeran,All of the Stars,"[Verse 1] It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star and thought of you I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew If you were here, I'd sing to you You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two I'm miles away from seeing you But I can see the stars from America I wondered, do you see them too? [Chorus] So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home [Verse 2] I can hear your heart on the radio beat They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us Back to the time you were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? You're the song my heart is beating to [Chorus] So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home [Outro] And oh, I know And oh, I know And oh I can see the stars From America",,0.7041420118,0.7985101744,44,56,1,0,20,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ed Sheeran,The Man,"[Verse 1] Now I don't wanna hate you Just wish you'd never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true, I kind of knew You liked the dude from private school He's waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He's not the right guy for you Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth No, I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But [fuck] it I won't be changing the subject, I love it I'll make your little secret public It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons You sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep Fact is you're mad at me Because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot? I think not [Chorus] I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore [Verse 2] Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much And at the time we'd just go, so sue me I guess I'm not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it's hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with [Chorus] I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore [Verse 3] And since you left, I've given up my days off It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career in music didn't exist In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing [Alice]? It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change [shit] Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest [Chorus] I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore",,0.3313609467,0.7821584302,76,72,58,0,8,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ed Sheeran,You Need Me I Dont Need You Live at the Bedford,"[Verse 1] Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound Playing a different show Every night in front of a new crowd That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud And I can't, no, I won`t hush I'll say the words that make you blush I'm gonna sing this now See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is I'm like glue, I stick to other artists I'm not you, now that would be disastrous Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me [Chorus] Cause you need me, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you (at all) You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you (at all) You need me [Verse 2] I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School I came fast with the way I act, right I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating When I perform live, feels like I am meditating Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi [Chorus] Cause you need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all) You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all) You need me [Verse 3] All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter? Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me? Hey, so I keep singing that When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top? I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy... My head in the sky... Ready to die Ed Sheeran, Alone Star Coming out here freestyling with the guitar Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the... [Interlude: ""In Da Club""] You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs Into having sex, I ain't into making love Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs Into having sex, I ain't into making love Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough [Break] My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning [Verse 4] Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine I blaze high grade weed all the time! Now my eyes are red [Chorus] Now my eyes are red Cause you need me, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red You need me man, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red And you need me, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red You need me man, I don't need you You need me man, I don't need you [Spoken] Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! (screaming) Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? (yeah!) West Ham, are you ready? (yeah!) Okay, West Ham, you sing this... You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you Millwall, you sing this: My eyes are red! You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, my eyes are red! You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, (my eyes are red!) (You need me, man, I don't need you) (You need me, man, my eyes are red!) You need me, man, I don't need you Millwall are winning I think [Verse 5] I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine Cause real recognise real is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you [Interlude] I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse! [Verse 6: Random Impulse] Yo! In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet Counting sheep and he's sound asleep Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers National lottery business, only winners have my numbers Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed! [Chorus] Cause you need me, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red You need me man, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red And you need me, I don't need you You need me man, my eyes are red You need me man, I don't need you You need me [Verse 7] I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift Into another rappers shoes using new laces Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache I hit back when the pen hurts me I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee I'm still the same as a year ago But more people hear me though According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio Melody music maker Reading all the papers They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator Later!

Ed Sheeran,You Need Me I Dont Need You - Live and in Session,"[Verse 1] Now I'm in town, break it down Thinking of making a new sound Playing a different show every night In front of a new crowd That's you now, ciao Seems that life is great now See me lose focus as I sing to you loud I can't, no I won't hush I'll say the words that make you blush I'm gonna sing this now See, I'm true My songs are where my heart is I'm like glue I stick to other artists I'm not you No, that would be disastrous Let me sing and do my thing And move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy I won't stay put Give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me Hey [Chorus] You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I

at all You need me, man [Verse 2] I sing, I write my own tunes And I write my own verse, hell Don't need another wordsmith To make my tune sell Call yourself a singer writer You're just bluffing Name's on the credits And you didn't write nothing I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school I came fast with the way I act right I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating When I perform live feels like I am meditating Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me Young singer/writer like a Gabriella Cilmi [Chorus]

burning on a spliff of your high-grade My eyes are red, I've been burning I've been burning burning burning [Verse 4] Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood One of the things that I've inherited Like a ghetto man you should One of the things is smoking weed Yes it makes me feel good But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug Where I come from all that talking It could only get you mugged Where I come from burning weed It is a blessing from above Where I come from, yes we burn it When we listen rob a dove Where I come from, yes we burn it After we dash to make love Where I come from, yes we burn it When the sun does shine I blaze high-grade weed all the time

are red Eyes are red Eyes are red Eyes are red Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah Yeah [Verse 5] Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right I won't stop till my name's in lights At stadium heights, with Damien Rice On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper Never be anything but a singer/songwriter Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up I've done around about a thousand shows, but I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow From day one I've been prepared With VO5 wax for my ginger hair So now I'm back to the sofa Giving a dose of what the future holds- Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes I rap with the cold flows I'm back with the most jokes In fact, you don't know On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate Man, flows developing Skin lacks the melanin Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in I do it for the hell of it Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team I seem to sell a bit I took what held me back with the women And then I packaged the image Put in some content And then I throw it back as a gimmick The fact is this I'll end up dating actresses Wake up on dirty mattresses I think I need to practice this But I make shit happen, call me a laxative World's on my shoulders I don't even know what Atlas is Hard part's sharp like a cactus is I'm back to rapping back to back Cause I've been practising I'm back to sing this, yes [Chorus] You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, at all You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, at all You need me, man [Verse 6] I'll keep my last name forever Keep this genre pretty basic Gonna be breaking into other people's tune When I chase it And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces I'm selling CD's from my rucksack Aiming for the papers Selling CD's from my rucksack Aiming for the majors Nationwide tour with Just Jack Still had to get the bus back Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache I hit back when the pen hurts me I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee I'm still the same as a year ago But, more people hear me, though According to the Myspace and Youtube videos I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio Melody music maker Reading all the papers They say I'm up and coming Like I'm fucking in an elevator [Chorus] You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, at all You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, at all You need me, man,

Ed Sheeran,The City Live at Sticky Studios,"[Verse 1] This city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when it’s late And sirens bleed through my windowsill I can’t close my eyes Don’t control what I’m into And this tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake My hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind Don’t control what I’m into [Pre-Chorus] London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home [Chorus] I’m burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat And I’m blazing on the street What I do isn’t up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two [Verse 2] The pavement is my friend It will take me where I need to go So I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I’m used to And the shop across the road Fulills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don’t think I’m gonna make it Past tomorrow [Pre-Chorus] And London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home [Chorus] Burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat And I’m blazing on the street What I do isn’t up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two [Bridge] And my lungs hurt And my ears bled With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head Do I need this To keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts, but I Need to move along [Verse 3] I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease Pollution in the air matches that on the street The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like I was a country boy when I moved out Grew up too fast for my family to find out Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies This city won’t erase me But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me It’s all the same see, music is my life, but Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from North, South, East, West, London’s my home now Knees weak, but we never slow down Now I start to do my music properly And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me [Pre-Chorus] And London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home [Chorus] Burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat And I’m blazing on the street What I do isn’t up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two Burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat And I’m blazing on the street What I do isn’t up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two",,0.4378698225,0.7999636628,71,57,51,0,41,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ed Sheeran,Candle in the Wind 2018 Version,[Verse 1] Goodbye Norma Jeane Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name [Chorus] And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did [Verse 2] Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude [Chorus] And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did [Verse 3] Goodbye Norma Jeane Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled Goodbye Norma Jeane From the young man in the 22nd row Who sees you as something more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe [Chorus] And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did,2018-04-06,0.2662721893,0.7191133721,55,45,73,0,12,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Ed Sheeran,Lately,"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran] I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine Cause real recognise real is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close [Verse 2: Devlin] 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? It's D-E-V to the Zed Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying Cause I got too much to stay awake for To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by [Hook: Ed Sheeran] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately [Verse 3: Ed Sheeran] I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) [Verse 4: Devlin] Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information And then decide what probably is most practical to do Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got I keep my pupils engaged Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake [Hook] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately",2011-09-09,0.349112426,0.808684593,72,82,9,0,39,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ed Sheeran,Drown Me Out,"[Verse 1: Ghetts] I'm in so deep Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill Keeping my head above water I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner So I move with the force of a sorcerer It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow And I'm parro, running out of ammo And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow The less then the better More proof for the last one left So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever? How can I be at my best with this pressure? I've got a lot to lose So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror No wonder I'm under stress I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave And invited more than a hundred guests I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back Back to 15, [?] I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat [Hook: Ed Sheeran] Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out You won't drown me out, out, out You won't drown me out [Verse 2: Ghetts] You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone I've never seen someone drown without A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining Plain sailing, no commotion Like a dolphin when it's in motion Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken? No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you Arm for arm, eye for eye I just want to live my life But they don't want to see this guy survive [Hook x2]",,0.6449704142,0.797056686,51,91,3,0,13,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ed Sheeran,Lego House Gosling Remix,"(P Money) [Verse 1] I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking ""how come I didn't even get a mention?"" Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception Ah, no bars, get it? Now I'm choking, no bars, get it? It turned cloudy, no stars, get it? I hit the ground so hard, headache Ah, it's mad I should be proud right now but I'm sad Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad (Ed Sheeran) [Hook] I'm out of touch, in a cold December Now Keep Me Warm I'm out of sight With all these things I've done Don't hold me down It's more than I can take Now I'm out of sight In a cold December (P Money) [Verse 2] Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them? I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton (Wow) I text her, ""you dissed it"". She don't reply like it's none of my business My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this? Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness (help) Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say ""I got P"" Ah, it's mad.

Ed Sheeran,Goodbye to You,"[Intro: Ed Sheeran] Hey, can you hear me I just wanted to let you know, hmm [Verse 1: Dot Rotten] I hope you can hear what I write to you How could I say goodbye to you? When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free Just locked in a cage slaving They said they were gold in the pavements But you came and saw the road to amazement Broke your heart But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast I hope your listening right I still think of you every Sunday No one can top your chicken and rice Even through the darkness times You held us all up because your vision was bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside You never let anyone see your heartache You just got on with it Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful And your words you would stand strong with it Cause they were like warmth on a winter night But I was just too young to go on with it And there somethings I could try to do But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you [Hook 1: Ed Sheeran (Dot Rotten)] And of the pieces of my soul (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh [Verse 2: Dot Rotten] I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now I would be by your side when you needed me Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths I miss seeing a family, being a family And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer Family problems have never been funny In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia She took all our inheritance money Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces I never forgive the way she betrayed us There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing But I guess that everyone's different Or should I say no one's perfect? She had happiness in front of her But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing Since you gone the foundations crumbled So building it back up is my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect So give me the strength that I need to perform this task Make it right, I must do And I ask cause I trust you It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you [Hook 1] And of the pieces of my soul (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh [Verse 3: Ed Sheeran] It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but I miss you, oh how I miss you It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but I miss you, oh how I miss you [Verse 4: Dot Rotten] There ain't enough words to describe How sorry I am for the pain that I caused Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood We were young and he said it was raping his broad And for the day police came to the door I'm sorry for being such a bad youth Stealing from your purse and making you mourn I never been able to say this before Cause I was so inconsiderate You loved me unconditionally And I took advantage of it like a idiot Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I really hope that you can forgive me You going away was a punishment But I won't let go I'm holding you with me But I still fight the emotions within me [Hook 2: Ed Sheeran] I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? And can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face Feel the chill of your warm embrace? And can I say goodbye to you? I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you?

I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you The anticipation of love makin' Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you News of precision will prepare ya In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror Now the picture's gettin' clearer All he does is hit you hard I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home I wonder should I leave you alone And find a woman of my own [Chorus: Charlie Puth] It's been a long day without you, my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again [Verse 2: 2Pac] Could it be my destiny to be lonely? Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me ‘Cause they phony But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious ‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin' Now your heart's tooken My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook Wanna take you there but you scared to follow Come see tomorrow Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more I told you before, no time to waste We can hook up at the store [Chorus: Charlie Puth] It's been a long day without you, my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again [Verse 3: 2Pac] I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin' In the position to pressure and offer competition Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely ‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see A happy home – that's my fantasy But my reality is problems with your man and me What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker ‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast Nobody knows, on who controls will it last? Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere And even if you stay with him today I'm still here I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare ‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know Passionately yours and I'll never let you go Tell me, can you get away?
